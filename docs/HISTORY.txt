**************

(name of developer listed in brackets)

1.4 (unreleased)
================

- Added ``escapechar`` option to CSVSourceSection blueprint.
  This allows to support escaped characters in CSV files (the Excel dialect,
  which is the default, uses None as default for escapechar, therefore
  disabling support for escaping entirely.
  [lgraf]

- Added .gitignore ignoring some of the usual stuff.
  [lgraf]

- Bug fix to load ZCML for GS when Products.GenericSetup is installed.
  [aclark]

1.3 (2011-03-17)
================

- Added the GenericSetup import context as an annotation to the transmogrifier.
  [elro]

- Added a logger to log the value of a particular key for all items. Handy
  when debugging, you can see which path is failing, and good if you want
  to show progress in a long import.
  [regebro]

- Added a breakpoint section to break on a particular expression, which is
  handy for debugging.

1.2 (2010-03-30)
================

- Bug fix: the constructor promises to encode paths to ASCII, but failed to
  do so. Thanks to gyst for finding the discrepancy.
  [mj]

1.1 (2010-03-17)
================

- Allow the CSV source to load its file from a package as well as from an
  absolute or relative file path. To load from a package, pass
  ``package.name:filename.csv`` to the ``filename`` option.
  [optilude]

- Add CMF 2.2/Plone 4 compatibility for the content constructor
  [optilude]

- Use an explicit provides attribute to register the transmogrifier adapter.
  Fixes the "Missing 'provides' attribute" errors when loading with
  zope.annotation installed.
  [mj]

- Add a required flag to the content constructor, which causes it to raise
  a KeyError if the container where to construct the new item doesn't exist.
  [regebro]

- Add an optional condition to the manipulator section.
  [regebro]

1.0 (2009-08-07)
