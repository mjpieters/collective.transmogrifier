================

- Added the GenericSetup import context as an annotation to the transmogrifier.
  [elro]

  handy for debugging.
  [regebro]

1.2 (2010-03-30)

- Allow the CSV source to load its file from a package as well as from an
  absolute or relative file path. To load from a package, pass

  a KeyError if the container where to construct the new item doesn't exist.
  [regebro]
