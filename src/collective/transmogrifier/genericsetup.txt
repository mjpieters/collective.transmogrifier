GenericSetup import integration
===============================

To ease running a transmogrifier pipeline during site configuration, a generic
import step for GenericSetup is included. 

The import step looks for a file named ``transmogrifier.txt`` and reads
pipeline configuration names from this file, one name per line. Empty lines
and lines starting with a # (hash mark) are skipped. These pipelines are then
executed in the same order as they are found in the file.

This means that if you want to run one or more pipelines as part of a
GenericSetup profile, all you have to do is name these pipelines in a file
named ``transmogrifier.txt`` in your profile directory.
